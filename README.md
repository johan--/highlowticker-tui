# HighLow TUI

Real-time session highs and lows across 571 S&P 500 components, in your terminal.

Tracks every stock making a new intraday high or low — color-coded by frequency, volume spikes, and % change. Built for 0DTE traders watching the equal-weight tape before it shows up on the index.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jach8/highlowticker-tui
cd highlowticker-tui
python3 -m venv highlowticker-venv
source highlowticker-venv/bin/activate  # Windows: highlowticker-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Coinbase (real-time crypto)

To stream live crypto data from Coinbase instead:

**1. Create `~/.highlowticker/config.toml`:**

```toml
[crypto]
broker = "coinbase"
```

**2. Add credentials to `.env` in the project root:**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your Coinbase API key and private key
```

Get your API key from [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api) — create a key with `read` scope on `advanced_trade`.

**3. Run:**

```bash
python app.py
```
